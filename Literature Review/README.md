## Literature Review 
The current design problem is making coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible and engaging to local residents to build such communities. People currently find their go-to coffee joints by word of mouth and social networking which is limited to auditory cues and one's own memory. Residents need an easier way to find new hidden gems based on the qualities they need to be productive, such as aesthetics, mood, number of seats, peak hours, Wi-Fi, etc. By making the knowledge and history of all things coffee accessible to users, this will elimnate the concept of the "coffee-snob" making the coffee community inclusive and welcoming.

Since social community and aesthetic design play a major role in human behavior in the everyday coffeeshop, they should 

This leads to the major design question: How might we make coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible to local residents while promoting social connectivity, productivity, and inclusivity in diverse coffee communities? Current food and restaurant apps allow users to explore new restaurants based on locations, however, they do not account for aesthetic and visual cues which are major design considerations of human behavior when choosing third place attachments. Current food and drink applications and websites do not integrate (history with...).
