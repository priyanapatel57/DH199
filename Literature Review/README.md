# Literature Review 
Priyana Patel

1. have a research goal/direction (and motivation) clear; 

- theoretical framework, practical guideline, or new style of (interaction) design, ...

2. draft the research question, most of you have it in the contract

3. select the keywords you will review, try to have 3-5 keywords

- for example, in this quarter, my research interest is "(local) history", "location based", "visualization" of "temporal/timeline". 

4. search relevant academic papers by putting the keywords & skim the abstracts; if you find it quite close to or relevant to your research direction, copy the abstracts into a document (I will provide an example); highlight the implication of the abstract and/or leave a note per each abstract your summary/interpretation

5. search relevant previous works, I would search app store with the relevant keywords. analyze the review.

6. think how your project/design can be unique from the previous research/products/apps. You will take the best of the previous works and avoid/learn from the mistakes/limitation form the previous works.

7. draft one page summary of the review. start with the introduction with your motivation/research interest, how you scan the relevant (previous) works, critically review the previous works with citation, then conclude with your research question by clearly state why no-one has been done this kind of research/design project, or why this work is unique and worthy, or how the outcome would contribute to whom.

8. update your web-documentation with the review. you may add contents or provide a link to the google doc (please make edit enable for me).
