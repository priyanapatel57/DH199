## Research Direction and Focus
I decided to hone in on a specific aspect of food culture as a social experience in Los Angeles: coffee. 

## Research Question 
How might we make coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible to local residents while promoting social connectivity, productivity, and inclusivity in diverse coffee communities? 

## Keywords
This quarter, my research interest is "coffee", "culture", "social", "aesthetics" and "productivity".

Current websites and apps provide a clean, aesthetic user experience for local residents to discover restaurants and coffeeshops in the area. "Source" provides handpicked, novelty coffeshops as well as user-submitted roasters that are approved based on high-quality standards. The app offers an integration with Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze to offer directions and easy access. The app, however, lacks a community and social experience. While it provides basic contact details, it lacks useful information that would help assist in decision-making, such as peak hours and number of seats. Across all location-based food apps, there lacks an educational feature that helps the user make decisions while also learning about the history of local eateries. 

## Literature Review 
The current design problem is making coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible and engaging to local residents to build such communities. People currently find their go-to coffee joints by word of mouth and social networking which is limited to auditory cues and one's own memory. Residents need an easier way to find new hidden gems based on the qualities they need to be productive, such as aesthetics, mood, number of seats, peak hours, Wi-Fi, etc. By making the knowledge and history of all things coffee accessible to users, this will elimnate the concept of the "coffee-snob" making the coffee community inclusive and welcoming.

Coffee culture has become ubiqitous and pervasive with the globalization of the modern, wired world (Tucker, 2017). As a social drug, coffee has permeated social spaces. Tastes in coffee and other cultural preferences represent the global impact on ethnic and religious identities as well as different food complexes and niches (Topik, 2009). The coffeehouse first emerged as a place for people to gather and drink coffee, learn about the news of the day, and discuss matters of mutual concern with other local residents (COWAN, 2005). Coffee shops are third places, a place between home and work. These are conductors in society which can provide neutral ground where one is able to connect. When choosing these places, human behavior shows we look for prositively experienced bonds over time with a socio-physical environment (FERREIRA & BEUSTER, 2019). Utimately, the space and architecture of a coffeehouse plays a major role in a user's coffee experience. Everyday aesthetics and ordinary affects generate a rich modality for body and mind in ordinary spaces. An aesthetic experience is one defined by organic rhythmic unity (Nautiyal, 2016). 

Since social community and aesthetic design play a major role in human behavior in the everyday coffee shop, they should be incorporated into how a user chooses their next coffee shop. This leads to the major design question: How might we make coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible to local residents while promoting social connectivity, productivity, and inclusivity in diverse coffee communities? Current food and restaurant apps allow users to explore new restaurants based on locations, however, they do not account for aesthetic and visual cues which are major design considerations of human behavior when choosing third place attachments. Users envision the space they would like to be in, such as seeing a friend's instagram post or story and a geolocation of the particular coffee shop. Current food discovery sources lack the strong component of a simple recommendation and how this is integrated within current social networking platforms, such as a forum or Q and A board. Lastly, food and drink sites underestimate the importance of education and history of establishments and how this is linked with brand identity. Current users seek to find the story of the spaces they take up in order to feel comfortable in connecting with others and progressing as individuals. The current design research project seeks to explore and create something that will cater and fufill such needs.
