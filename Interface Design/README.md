## Color and Typography 
I decided to use variations of red and brown in my color palette. Yelp and other food applications use red as an attention grabber to evoke the tastebuds. The color brown, secondary to red, represents the natural relevance to coffee, in its bean and drink form. Brown is associated with being close to earth and "grounded", hence the literal reference to the name of this future mobile design.
