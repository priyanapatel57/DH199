# Interface Design 
Priyana Patel

## Color and Typography 
I decided to use variations of red and brown in my color palette. Yelp and other food applications use red as an attention grabber to evoke the tastebuds. The color brown, secondary to red, represents the natural relevance to coffee, in its bean and drink form. Brown is associated with being close to earth and "grounded", hence the literal reference to the name of this future mobile design. I used Red (#8C2016) for actionable buttons and text and I used Dark Brown (#401E17) for all informational, non-actionable text. I used a combination of red and brown (#9F5049) for accent colors and banners.

## Revisions
"Filter" button - "All" with filter icon </br>
Results Page with stacked cards - See all cards at once, similar to Pinterest's interface (each result appears with the price range, whether it is open or closed, the rating, and capacity/peak hours level) </br>
Purpose of trip - Provide more info with each option such as "Work - I'm trying to get some work done", "Social - I want to connect with friends", "Professional - I'm meeting with clients/mentors" </br>
