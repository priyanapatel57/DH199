# User Research Planning
## DH199: Navigating American Coffee Culture in Los Angeles

### Purpose
To find the insights from the users (or someone other than you) to solve the main design challenges you want to suggest with your ux prototype

Acitivy: What is the thing the users would do with your web/app?
What is the main activity your project would support the users?
What is the basic need involved for that activity?
What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
Target users: What is the characteristics of users?
So you can find the close person who can show you how to do that activity. Or, you can find someone who knows well about such type of users (experts). Or, at least you can asks someone (or yourself) play the role of that type of users.

Context of use: Where would the users do that activity?
so, where would you like to visit to meet the users? (location, or virtual space?)
what is user's goal when the user is there (at the place at that moment to that activity)
what kind of operations the users would do?
what is the methods the users would use?
What is the action the users take?
Research methods (direct/ passive/ partipatory/ or creative combination of them, or other methods)
Describe the methods such as whether you will observe the users behaviors (maybe from youtubes, or films... to be creative) or you will ask directly to the users with some quesitons (via email? or in person if someone in your family or friend, or via phone/ video call? -- in this video call you can ask the person to show their screen by sharing -- or show some artefacts they use for the activity, like could you show me your calendar how you planned the trip?)
you may want to consider the diary/journal as a research method as well -- to ask someone write down details regarding that activity
Plan specific quesitons or resquest for the observation/ interview guide
Decide where to visit (virtually or in person if you are lucky to access such a place easily, by keeping social distance)
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images), so you need to know whehter you will record or ask your interviewee to record or something else.
Write down your plan as a script -- prepare the interview guide
