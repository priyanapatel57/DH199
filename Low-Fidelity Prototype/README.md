## Evaluation
I tested my low-fidelity prototype with two potential users. The first user was not sure how to navigate the search results page: she noted that it would be helpful if the coffee shop cards were labeled at the top so that the names were visible. While she was familiar with the varying levels of the price range filter, she was unsure of what the varying levels for seating, outlets, and noise meant. The second user had the impression that the cards feed on screen 2 followed the notion of "swipe left to disregard and swipe right to favorite". He mentioned that having the like icon in the top right-hand corner was counterintuitive, specifying that it would take more effort to double-tap to favorite the icon. He said that it would be helpful if the "See All" and "Back" buttons were bigger. He was unsure whether there were more pictures of the coffee shop: he indicated a marker for multiple pictures would help him.

Based on my evaluations, I need to reconsider how I would like to structure and design my search feed. I believe a swipe left and swipe right motion would be more intuitive for the user however it would not allow them to go back and forth between search results; once a card is swiped left, they cannot return to it. Additionally, I need to make my navigation buttons ("Back", etc.) bigger and more visible. I think it would be helpful to use an additional icon with the "See All" button to indicate to the user that they can navigate to the coffee shop's photo gallery.
