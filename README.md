## Project Description 
I am interested in exploring the diverse cuisines of Los Angeles and how food was and is currently reflected in the social and dining experience of local residents. From coffee shops to brunch spots to fine dining, food represents a social activity of gathering and productivity. Los Angeles is comprised of residents of multiple races, nationalities, and backgrounds which is directly reflected in the food we eat. For myself, food is an integral part of my cultural identity as a British-American of Gujarati Indian origin, having lived in Los Angeles for the past four years as a student. Food is a dual symbol of cultural preservation and unique connections.

The current design problem is making the history of food culture in Los Angeles more accessible and engaging to the public. People currently access food in Los Angeles by word of mouth and social networking. People seek how these popular establishments came to be and how Los Angeles has defined itself as one of the most popular food cities.  

## Expected Outcome
I plan to improve the current user experience through a location-based navigation and a walkthrough of the history of food and culture. I will document my design process and final prototype through web documentation and a research paper. I hope to further my design portfolio and storytelling skills through this directed research opportunity, learning how to improve the user experience of my local community through extensive research and iterative development.
