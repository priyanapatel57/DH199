## Project Description 
I am interested in exploring the evolution of coffee culture of Los Angeles and how coffee is currently reflected in the social experience of local residents. Coffee represents a social activity of gathering while also promoting individual productivity. Los Angeles is comprised of residents of multiple races, nationalities, and backgrounds which is directly reflected (link diversity, coming together, coffee culture, aesthetics (LA)). For myself, food is an integral part of my cultural identity as a British-American of Gujarati Indian origin, having lived in Los Angeles for the past four years as a student. Food is a dual symbol of cultural preservation and unique connections. Coffee America Tea England. 

The current design problem is making the history of food culture in Los Angeles more accessible and engaging to the public. People currently access food in Los Angeles by word of mouth and social networking. People seek how these popular establishments came to be and how Los Angeles has defined itself as one of the most popular food cities. Problem (hidden gems, more accessible to the public through filters they need such as recommendations, things increase connectivity and productivity (number of chargers, tables, seats, accessibiliy)  

empowering, creating new spaces 

## Expected Outcome
I plan to improve the current user experience through a location-based navigation and a history walkthrough of coffee culture in Los Angeles. I will document my design process and final prototype through web documentation and a research paper. I hope to further my design portfolio and storytelling skills through this directed research opportunity, learning how to improve the user experience of my local community through extensive research and iterative development.
