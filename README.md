## Project Overview 
### Project Description 
I am interested in exploring the evolution of coffee culture of Los Angeles and how coffee is currently reflected in the social experience of local residents. Coffee shops represent social acitivities for connection as well as spaces to empower individuals. Los Angeles is comprised of residents of multiple races, nationalities, and backgrounds which is directly reflected in the abundance of coffee communities. For myself as a student in Los Angeles, coffee shops are go-to spots for productive study sessions, informational interviews and catching up with friends. 

The current design problem is making coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible and engaging to local residents to build such communities. People currently find their go-to coffee joints by word of mouth and social networking which is limited to auditory cues and one's own memory. Residents need an easier way to find new hidden gems based on the qualities they need to be productive, such as aesthetics, mood, number of seats, peak hours, Wi-Fi, etc. By making the knowledge and history of all things coffee accessible to users, this will elimnate the concept of the "coffee-snob" making the coffee community inclusive and welcoming. 

### Expected Outcome
I plan to improve the current user experience through a location-based navigation and a history walkthrough of coffee culture in Los Angeles. I will document my design process and final prototype through web documentation and a research paper. I hope to further my design portfolio and storytelling skills through this directed research opportunity, learning how to improve the user experience of my local community through extensive research and iterative development.

Current websites and apps provide a clean, aesthetic user experience for local residents to discover restaurants and coffeeshops in the area. "Source" provides handpicked, novelty coffeshops as well as user-submitted roasters that are approved based on high-quality standards. The app offers an integration with Apple Maps, Google Maps, and Waze to offer directions and easy access. The app, however, lacks a community and social experience. While it provides basic contact details, it lacks useful information that would help assist in decision-making, such as peak hours and number of seats. Across all location-based food apps, there lacks an educational feature that helps the user make decisions while also learning about the history of local eateries. 

### Literature Review 
The current design problem is making coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible and engaging to local residents to build such communities. People currently find their go-to coffee joints by word of mouth and social networking which is limited to auditory cues and one's own memory. Residents need an easier way to find new hidden gems based on the qualities they need to be productive, such as aesthetics, mood, number of seats, peak hours, Wi-Fi, etc. By making the knowledge and history of all things coffee accessible to users, this will elimnate the concept of the "coffee-snob" making the coffee community inclusive and welcoming.

Coffee culture has become ubiqitous and pervasive with the globalization of the modern, wired world (Tucker, 2017). As a social drug, coffee has permeated social spaces. Tastes in coffee and other cultural preferences represent the global impact on ethnic and religious identities as well as different food complexes and niches (Topik, 2009). The coffeehouse first emerged as a place for people to gather and drink coffee, learn about the news of the day, and discuss matters of mutual concern with other local residents (COWAN, 2005). Coffee shops are third places, a place between home and work. These are conductors in society which can provide neutral ground where one is able to connect. When choosing these places, human behavior shows we look for prositively experienced bonds over time with a socio-physical environment (FERREIRA & BEUSTER, 2019). Utimately, the space and architecture of a coffeehouse plays a major role in a user's coffee experience. Everyday aesthetics and ordinary affects generate a rich modality for body and mind in ordinary spaces. An aesthetic experience is one defined by organic rhythmic unity (Nautiyal, 2016). 

Since social community and aesthetic design play a major role in human behavior in the everyday coffee shop, they should be incorporated into how a user chooses their next coffee shop. This leads to the major design question: How might we make coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible to local residents while promoting social connectivity, productivity, and inclusivity in diverse coffee communities? Current food and restaurant apps allow users to explore new restaurants based on locations, however, they do not account for aesthetic and visual cues which are major design considerations of human behavior when choosing third place attachments. Users envision the space they would like to be in, such as seeing a friend's instagram post or story and a geolocation of the particular coffee shop. Current food discovery sources lack the strong component of a simple recommendation and how this is integrated within current social networking platforms, such as a forum or Q and A board. Lastly, food and drink sites underestimate the importance of education and history of establishments and how this is linked with brand identity. Current users seek to find the story of the spaces they take up in order to feel comfortable in connecting with others and progressing as individuals. The current design research project seeks to explore and create something that will cater and fufill such needs.

## User Research Planning
The purpose of this user research is to gain insights from users to help make coffee shops in Los Angeles, aligned with the coffee experience, more accessible while promoting social connectivity, productivity, and inclusivity in diverse coffee communities.

### Main Design Challenge 
My project would allow users to easily find new coffee shops in the local area based on social and productive filters using location-based navigation. With easier and more functional pathways to Los Angeles coffee shops, users will be able to strengthen their knowledge and association with coffee while integrating themselves within their respective coffee community. According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, the basic need that this activity will fulfill is self-actualization. While coffee is classified as food and drink, prior research suggests that people rarely seek the coffee shop experience solely to grab their daily dose of coffee. People go to coffeeshops to find consistency and productivity in a unique third space (a space between a primary home and secondary work). Individuals also seek the full bodily experience combined with taste, aroma, noise, and the feeling of being surrounded by strangers. 

Current solutions to ease the navigation process include food and drink exploration and reservations apps, such as OpenTable and Yelp. These platforms, however, do not distinguish the coffee shop as a unique, aesthetic experience through the modality of body and mind. More specific solutions help users look for high-quality, specialty coffee shops in the local area. While they are currently in the process of growing and are lesser known, they focus on providing detailed shop info to help users find "better" coffee. These solutions again neglect a user's connection and physical experience while navigating local coffeeshops on a virtual platform. Digital technology can help connect coffee drinkers based on time, experience, and word of mouth. Coffee communities can share their particular experiences in a unique space through imagery, sound, and video. Possible mediums through which this can be achieved include recreating the experience inside a coffee shop through virtual reality for a user to fully gauge their future experience. Additionally, incorporating an interactive learning process can help further the enrichment process. 

### Target Users 
target users (amateur to coffee snob, those who frequent coffee shops on daily basis to)

Target users: What is the characteristics of users?
So you can find the close person who can show you how to do that activity. Or, you can find someone who knows well about such type of users (experts). Or, at least you can asks someone (or yourself) play the role of that type of users.

### Research Method 
Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.
Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)

Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
Decide where to visit
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users 
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)
Prepare the interview guide (examples + template here -- this guide is designed for search activity but you need to edit with your contextual questions according to the activity, not search activity, you want to learn from the users)

Step05: Conduct the research
Visit the place
Meet/Observe the user(s)
Collect the data (record, pictures, answered_survey)



Context of use: Where would the users do that activity?
so, where would you like to visit to meet the users? (location, or virtual space?)
what is user's goal when the user is there (at the place at that moment to that activity)
what kind of operations the users would do?
what is the methods the users would use?
What is the action the users take?
Research methods (direct/ passive/ partipatory/ or creative combination of them, or other methods)
Describe the methods such as whether you will observe the users behaviors (maybe from youtubes, or films... to be creative) or you will ask directly to the users with some quesitons (via email? or in person if someone in your family or friend, or via phone/ video call? -- in this video call you can ask the person to show their screen by sharing -- or show some artefacts they use for the activity, like could you show me your calendar how you planned the trip?)
you may want to consider the diary/journal as a research method as well -- to ask someone write down details regarding that activity
Plan specific quesitons or resquest for the observation/ interview guide
Decide where to visit (virtually or in person if you are lucky to access such a place easily, by keeping social distance)
Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do
Decide how to interact with the users
Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images), so you need to know whehter you will record or ask your interviewee to record or something else.
Write down your plan as a script -- prepare the interview guide
