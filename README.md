## Project Description 
I am interested in exploring the evolution of coffee culture of Los Angeles and how coffee is currently reflected in the social experience of local residents. Coffee shops represent social acitivities for connection as well as spaces to empower individuals. Los Angeles is comprised of residents of multiple races, nationalities, and backgrounds which is directly reflected in the abundance of coffee communities. For myself as a student in Los Angeles, coffee shops are go-to spots for productive study sessions, informational interviews and catching up with friends. 

The current design problem is making coffee culture in Los Angeles more accessible and engaging to local residents to build such communities. People currently find their go-to coffee joints by word of mouth and social networking which is limited to auditory cues and one's own memory. Residents need an easier way to find new hidden gems based on the qualities they need to be productive, such as aesthetics, mood, number of seats, peak hours, Wi-Fi, etc. By making the knowledge and history of all things coffee accessible to users, this will elimnate the concept of the "coffee-snob" making the coffee community inclusive and welcoming. 

## Expected Outcome
I plan to improve the current user experience through a location-based navigation and a history walkthrough of coffee culture in Los Angeles. I will document my design process and final prototype through web documentation and a research paper. I hope to further my design portfolio and storytelling skills through this directed research opportunity, learning how to improve the user experience of my local community through extensive research and iterative development.
