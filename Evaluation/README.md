# Evaluation
Priyana Patel 

## 1) Methods 
I evaluated my interactive prototype through a google forms usability test. In the **pre-test**, I asked the user to complete a 5-second impression test where they viewed an image of the screens for 5 seconds. After, they were asked to rate their agreement with the following terms on a 5-point Likert scale: *Aesthetic, Symmetrical, Pleasant, Organized, Clean*. This visual appeal questionnaire was developed by Lavie and Tractinsky to measure classical aesthetics (Lavie and Tractinsky 2004). I also asked if they could recall any particular elements from the design and what they liked about the design to further understand a user's impression of the design. In the **tasks** section, I asked the user to complete the following four groups of tasks to test the flow and usability of the deesign. 

1. Complete the search field 
2. Evaluate search results
3. Learn more about the coffee shop
4. Further steps to plan your visit 

In the **post-test questionnaire**, I asked the user to rate the difficulty of the task and the time it took to complete the task. To measure perceived productivity, social connectivity, and accessibility, I asked users to rate their agreement with statements that suggested that their experience with the app would improve such areas. Lastly, I used a **system usability scale - sus** to evaluate the comprehensive usability of the mobile application.

## 2) Survey Data

### Five Second Test
Average Visual Appeal (5 - Strongy Agree, 4 - Agree, 3 - Neutral, 2 - Disagree, 1 - Strongly Disagree) </br>
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|Aesthetic: 4.4| Symmetrical: 3.6| Pleasant: 4| Organized: 4| Clean: 4.2|

Elements: Participants recalled beige colors and a brown color scheme, a grid style picture layout, and a map. 

Design Affirmations: Participants stated that they liked the visual appeal, simplicity and cleanliness, the colors, the map and image integration, and the minimal text. 

### Tasks
Four out of five users (80%) were able to complete all subtasks within the four main task groups. One user was unable to view the search results on a map view and go to the store's Instagram page.

Coffee Shop Evaluation: 80% of users stated that Black Canvas Coffee met their study needs. Participants mentioned that based on their evaluation, the coffee shop has few to no outlets which would make charging their laptop difficult. One user also included that there was not a lot of seating and there was no backing on the chairs. These results indicate a typical user's ability to evaluate a search result based on the provided information. When asked if there was any pertinent or useful information missing, 20% of users (1 participant) stated "popular menu items".  

### Post-Test Questionnaire

Productivity, Social Connectivity, Accessibility (7 - Strongly Agree, 6 - Agree, 5 - Somewhat Agree, 4 - Neutral, 3 - Somewhat Disagree, 2 - Disagree, 1 - Strongly Disagree) </br>
I believe the app experience will improve my personal productivity and future experiences in coffee shops: 6.4
I believe the app experience promotes my opportunities for social connectivity: 6.2
I believe the app experience allows for creative exploration to increase accessibility to coffee communities: 6

System Usability Scale </br>
The average participant SUS score was 79 which is higher than the average SUS score of 68. 

## 3) Summary 

Overall, all participants agree that the visual design is aesthetic, organized, pleasant and clean. Users report, however, lower average ratings with respect to the design being symmetical in classical aesthetics. Prominent elements of the design include the grid-style layout, the location-based navigation, and the color scheme. 80% of users were able to complete all tasks in the navigation flow however one user had difficulty in accessing the map view and navigation to external applications. Participants found that completing the search field, learning more about the coffee shop, and completing further steps to plan their visit within the *Easy* scale rating and found that evaluating search results within the *Somewhat Easy* scale rating. Participants found learning more about the coffee shop and completing further steps to plan their visit shorter tan expected, completing the search field somewhat shorter than expected, and evaluating the search results as expected with respect to the time it took to complete the task. Lastly, participants on average agree that using the app would help improve their productivity and future experiences in coffee shops, promote their opportunities for social connectivity, and increase their accessibility to coffee communities. 

## 4) Revision Plan 
Based on extensive feedback from Professor Cho and two users, I plan to make the following revisions:

Complete the search field:
1. Change the arrow icon to "Continue/Search" or only make appear once the search form is complete
2. Add a "continue" button that takes you back to the homepage after you enter your location
3. Add a title and label to make it clearer for users when entering their location
4. Change "Work" to "Productivity" (*work* can be synonymous with *professional*)
5. Include a label for location: "Where would you like to find a coffee shop?"

Evaluate the search results:
1. Make the map accessible by tapping in addition to dragging
2. For the filter page, group the icons together (price, seating, outlets, etc.)
3. Change the distance filter to a drag/slider bar
4. Instructions that explain what the capacity colors mean
5. Add a "Sort" button and make the results default by capacity/how busy
6. Remove the horizontal scroll of the filter tags and change to icons
7. Embed the name of the coffee shop on the image

Learn more about the coffee shop:
1. Add Yelp average star review 
2. Include how many seats not taken 
3. Change the amenities to 3 by 3 grid or a check to indicate whether the shop has it 

Further steps to plan your visit:
1. Option to pick which rideshare app to open (Uber or Lyft)
2. Make the actionable button text more concise (call, map, web, ride)
3. Link "Copy Address" with the share icon 

Additionally, I plan to certain design changes to maintain visual consistency and ensure that colors are AA WCAG compliant. Regarding the product itself, I would like to reconsider the "What is your coffee knowledge" feature. Based on my user research and storytelling, coffee knowledge is associated with experience and personal value. If so, results in accordance with a user's coffee knowledge would be reflected in the variety in a menu and the quality of the coffee. I plan to complete further user research to under the value of such feature and how this would help find coffee shops that match their needs, desires, and previous experience in coffee shops.
