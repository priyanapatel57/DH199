# Evaluation
Priyana Patel 

## 1) Methods 
I evaluated by interactive prototype through a google forms usability test. I asked the user to first rate the visual usability of the design and then complete four groups of tasks:

1. Complete the search field 
2. Evaluate search results
3. Learn more about the coffee shop
4. Further steps to plan your visit 

View the google [form](https://forms.gle/tFAbvmP1CSYsTwoE8)
