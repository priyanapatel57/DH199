## Usage Scenario

|Sylvie|Yasmin|
|------|------|
|Sylvie is a busy college student looking for a new coffee shop to study at this weekend. She has a very high knowledge of coffee and She knows her regular places near campus will be busy so she would like to take the opportunity to explore and find a new one. Her main priorities when looking for a new coffee shop are that it is has **good quality coffee, is close to campus, within her price range, and has good reviews**. Her preferences for an ideal study environment are that the coffee shop is open and large in size and has a lot of seating. Sylvie plans on grabbing her coffee and setting up with her laptop and study materials. She plans on bringing her charger in the hopes that the shop is equipped with outlets around seating areas.|Yasmin is a recent college graduate looking to spend her time exploring new coffee shops this weekend. She is looking for aesthetic cafes which have a great opportunity for an Instagram photo-op as opposed to the main chain coffee stores she currently visits. Her main priorities when looking for a new coffee shop are **price, distance, and variety in the menu**. Yasmin just started drinking coffee within the past few years in college when she would meet up with friends and study. She would like start exploring more as she will start grad school in Seattle in the fall, but Yasmin is a little unsure where to start.

## User Journey

||Sylvie|Yasmin|
|------|------|------|
|Goal|Sylvie's goal is to find a new coffee shop, filtering by location, price, and reviews. She types in **"coffee"** into the Yelp app, editing her location to "UCLA" and making the refinement "good for groups". She is excited and hopeful for the search results to explore new shops in the local area.|Yasmin's goal is to discover a new mom and pop coffee shop, different from the chain coffee shops she usually frequents, in order to broaden her coffee knowledge. She types in "**coffee shops** near me" into her Google search engine on her mobile device. She is hopeful and sure that her search will bring up a multitude of results.|
|Challenge|Sylvie's challenge once she finds a promising coffee shop is figuring out whether the shop will be busy when she gets there and whether there will be enough seating. She sifts through reviews, specifically looking for key terms such as "popular", "crowded", or "busy". She also analyzes pictures of the interior space, looking at tables, seats, and how open the space is.|Yasmin's challenge is finding distinct cafes amidst chain coffee shops such as Starbucks and Peet's Coffee in her search results feed. Additionally, she does not typically archive her findings for future visits; if the name is obscure or the shop is not within her top five search results, she has trouble remembering it again. If she has found a promising choice, she seeks advice from her friends with more experience via iMessage to confirm before her visit.|
|Solution|A solution for Sylvie is a specialized digital tool for coffee which provides a guided search exploration by goal with markers for seating, size/capacity, and peak hours. Sylvie would begin her search by selecting the purpose of her coffee shop search: "to study". Results would account for size/capacity, seating, number of outlets, and free Wi-Fi in addition to price, reviews, distance, and hours. She feels relieved and relaxed knowing she can save time on her search, without having to look through lots of reviews and pictures.|A solution for Yasmin is a rapid discovery page which can be filtered by vibes and aesthetics as well as personalized by coffee knowledge. She will see a live, consistently changing view of trending and popular coffee shops based on visual appeal (images linked via Instagram). Each digital card can be easily archived into a favorites list so that Yasmin can continue to explore without losing reference to a possible coffee shop she would like to view at a later time/ Yasmin is motivated and inspired by the wide variety of choices she has available to her and is relieved that she does not have to confirm her choice with her friends.
